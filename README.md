It's a POC to implement (DCI)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction]. Later on I learned DDD and bounded contexts, it's a more elegant solution to implement different use-cases for the same domain imhe.

It was a fun exercise to improve my TDD and clean code skills, and to explore run-time IL generation. Don't use it, use extension methods instead.
